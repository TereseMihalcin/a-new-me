One of my hobbies is coming up with project ideas and never starting them, or starting them a year later, or starting them and not touching them for months on end.

I like having personal code/website projects to work on. It keeps me inspired and curious about new web technologies. This blog was fun to setup and Astro made it very easy. I also recently made a wedding website for me and Lizzy, even though we've done minimal wedding planning. I've been trying to start a ruby on rails project with a friend but Rails is very different, and It requires me to use Lizzy's PC, which is not ideal most of the time. I'm into the tiny game console called a Playdate. It's very cute, and fun to play while traveling. It seems like a good gateway into game development, but i've just been slacking. I'm sure it's partly because I don't think i'll be good at it, math doesn't come naturally to me so I know it'll be a challenge. So whateves, i'll get to them all eventually. And hopefully blog about them when I do.

Outside of code, my project list includes fixing an old bike, building my own PC, installing Linux on an old Mac. and probably more. Unfortunately, I'm not smart enough to do most of these things on my own. Lizzy's helped me a lot with the Bike building. The process is brutal. Did you know bike mechanics requires an extremely large amount of custom tools? I sure didn't. An allen wrench ain't gonna cut it.  If you need to get down and dirty with the cabling or wheels or whatever like me, you'll need like a whole case of new, weird tools. Sometimes differing per bicycle. Unfortunetely for me I screwed with the back wheel so much that I forgot how to put it back together. It's in one piece for now, but i'm too scared to ride it because i'm pretty sure it's wrong. Next step is recabling...which is gonna be a full day thing for sure. Anyway I suck at building things with my hands like that. It takes Lizzy 1/3 of the time to complete the same task as me, and that's an accurate statistic.
